# Handle Grandparents with care in December: An assessment of older-adult mortality and potential implications for grandchildren (students!)

Author: Alexis R. Santos

# *Abstract*

Anecdotal evidence gathered by professors and teachers have documented an increased number of deaths close to final exams or the end of the academic year. However, no previous study has assessed whether grandparents are more likely to die in May or December in comparison to other months. This paper reviews data from the National Vital Statistics System in the United States over an 18-year period (2000-2017). I study trends and patterns in deaths of older-adults (55 and older) in the United States, and by age-groups to determine whether age groups in which most grandparents fall experience increased deaths in the months of interest. This paper reports an upward trend in number of deaths for adults older than 55 years in the United States. The general population of interest did not experience increased deaths in any month. However, an analysis that stratified by age groups, identified higher number of deaths for those who are 75-84 years old, 85 and older.
